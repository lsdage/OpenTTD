## OpenTTD

This is a forked version of [OpenTTD](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD) with hardcoded setting that makes the industries
around the map to **never** close down.

See a bit of a background on the [OpenTTD forum](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=47233).

Long story short:

- This feature may be helpful on huge maps.

- This feature is not officially supported by OpenTTD.

- There may and will be problems with NewGRF industries.

- NewGRF vehicles, like [PikkaBird's](http://pikka.users.tt-forums.net/wiki/), seem to work fine.
